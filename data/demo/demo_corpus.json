Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9. After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, Messi became an integral part of the ``Baby Dream Team '', Barcelona's greatest - ever youth side. During his first full season (2002 -- 03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the Cadetes A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups. The Copa Catalunya final, a 4 -- 1 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the partido de la m\u00e1scara, the final of the mask. A week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, Messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. At the close of the season, he received an offer to join Arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while F\u00e0bregas and Piqu\u00e9 soon left for England, he chose to remain in Barcelona."}, {"title": "FC Barcelona", "text": "Despite being the favourites and starting strongly, Barcelona finished the 2006\u201307 season without trophies.
